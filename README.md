# Track-Activities-To-do-list-App
A to do list app that can display how much time you spent in these activities in a chart.
This is my Xcode project that contains a working application.

Also make sure to click on white workspace file rather than blue project file

The View folder has all the views that the app contains

the Resources folder holds extensions and color combinations
